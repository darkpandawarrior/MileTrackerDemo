/**
 * Maps a platform [GeoPoint] into the tracking pipeline's [GpsFix].
 *
 * **Why this lives in commonMain rather than next to its iOS caller.** CoreLocation reports a
 * *negative* `speed` and `course` to mean "not available" — it does not use null, and `GeoPoint`'s
 * own defaults (`-1f` / `-1.0`) exist for exactly that reason. Letting those through would push a
 * negative speed into the jitter gate and `DynamicIntervalCalculator`, and a negative bearing into
 * the quality signal. That guard is real logic and deserves a test.
 *
 * It previously sat as a private function in `IosTrackingController` (iosMain), where nothing could
 * test it — the repo has no `iosTest` source set anywhere, and adding one to this module is not
 * cheap: Kotlin/Native rejects backtick test names containing `,`/`(`/`)`, which this module's
 * existing commonTest uses in 39 places across 22 files, so enabling `iosTest` here would mean
 * renaming tests unrelated to the change. Both [GeoPoint] and [GpsFix] are commonMain types, so
 * moving the mapping down is the smaller and more honest fix — and it matches the convention already
 * documented on kmp-toolkit's `InjectableNativeLlm` ("kept in commonMain, not iosMain, so this
 * logic is unit-testable").
 *
 * Altitude and accuracy are passed through untouched: a negative altitude is meaningful (below sea
 * level), unlike the speed/course sentinels.
